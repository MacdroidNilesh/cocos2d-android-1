#summary How to use cocos2d in my application?

= Introduction =

You have downloaded latest cocos2d and run it. And now you are ready to start your project. But what should you do?


= Details =

  # Import cocos2d in workspace.
  # Go to project properties and mark cocos2d as library.
  # Create now your project and add cocos2d library in project properties.
  # If you are using box2d maybe you had to add .so to your project like cocos(libs/...).
  # Now you can write your game.

Also you can include all sources into your project, and no need in any cocos2d jar.
